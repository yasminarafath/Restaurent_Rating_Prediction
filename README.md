🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction

A Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Project by Cognifyz Technologies

📘 Project Overview

The Restaurant Rating Prediction project aims to analyze and predict restaurant ratings based on multiple influencing factors such as cuisine type, location, price range, booking options, and delivery availability. This project was completed as part of the Cognifyz Technologies Data Science Internship Program, covering data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling across multiple structured levels.

🧾 Objectives

1.Perform data exploration and preprocessing to understand dataset characteristics.

2.Conduct statistical and geospatial analyses to uncover meaningful patterns.

3.Build predictive models to estimate restaurant ratings.

4.Visualize key insights to support business decision-making.

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about restaurants, including:

-Restaurant details: Name, location, cuisines, average cost, etc.

-Customer feedback: Aggregate rating, votes, and color representation.

-Service features: Table booking and online delivery options.

-Geolocation data: Latitude and longitude for mapping.

⚙️ Project Workflow
Level 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing
🧩 Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

-Imported and explored the dataset to identify number of rows and columns.

-Checked and handled missing values and ensured correct data types.

-Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings and checked for class imbalances.

📊 Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

-Computed statistical summaries (mean, median, std. deviation) for numeric features.

-Explored categorical variables such as Country Code, City, and Cuisines.

-Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

🗺️ Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

-Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude.

-Analyzed distribution across cities/countries.

-Checked for correlation between ratings and restaurant location.

Level 2: Advanced Analysis and Feature Engineering
🪑 Task 1: Table Booking & Online Delivery Analysis

-Calculated the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.

-Compared average ratings of restaurants with and without these services.

-Studied delivery availability trends across different price ranges.

💰 Task 2: Price Range Analysis

-Identified the most common price range among restaurants.

-Calculated average ratings within each price range.

-Determined the rating color corresponding to highest-rated categories.

🧠 Task 3: Feature Engineering

-Created new features such as:

  -Has_Table_Booking

  -Has_Online_Delivery

  -Length of restaurant name and address.

-Encoded categorical variables to make them model-ready for machine learning.

Level 3: Predictive Modeling and Insights
🤖 Task 1: Predictive Modeling

-Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

-Implemented and compared multiple regression algorithms:

  -Linear Regression

  -Decision Tree Regressor

  -Random Forest Regressor

  -Gradient Boosting Regressor

-Evaluated models using RMSE and R² scores.

-Found Random Forest and Gradient Boosting as top-performing models.

🍝 Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

-Analyzed the relationship between cuisine types and ratings.

-Identified most popular cuisines based on number of votes.

-Highlighted cuisines that consistently received higher ratings.

📈 Task 3: Data Visualization

-Visualized rating distributions using histograms and bar plots.

-Compared average ratings across cuisines and cities.

-Created correlation plots to show relationships between features and the target variable.

🧮 Tools and Technologies Used

-Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

  -Data Handling: pandas, numpy

  -Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

  -Modeling: scikit-learn

  -Geospatial Mapping: folium

-Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results Summary

-Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for ML applications.

-Derived meaningful insights on restaurant trends, cuisines, and customer behavior.

-Achieved accurate rating prediction using ensemble learning methods.

-Built compelling visual dashboards for clear interpretation of results.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrated a complete data science workflow, from raw data exploration to model evaluation. The insights derived can help restaurant aggregators and businesses understand factors affecting ratings, thereby improving service quality and customer satisfaction.
